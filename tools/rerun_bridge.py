"""Streams the robot, its odometry, velocities, Nav2 goal and plan, and camera
video into Rerun for timeline debugging. Complements RViz/Foxglove rather than
replacing them: scrub commanded vs actual velocity next to the robot moving in
the odom frame, with the camera views alongside.

The model comes from /robot_description (the same URDF robot_state_publisher
serves), placed in the odom frame from odometry, wheels turned from
/joint_states. The odom path is drawn in the 3D view and in a top-down view.

Nav2: /goal_pose (what RViz's 2D Goal Pose publishes), /plan and /local_plan
are drawn in both views. There is no localisation yet, map -> odom is an
identity transform, so map poses are drawn as odom poses.

The slam_toolbox map (/map) is drawn as points in the map frame, with map -> odom from
/tf, so the robot, the scan and the plan sit in the map as SLAM sees it. The map frame
starts at the robot's start pose.

With amcl running, the particle cloud (/particle_cloud) is drawn in the map frame too.

The LD19 scan (/ldlidar_node/scan) is drawn as points in its own frame, coloured
by beam angle from red at scan angle 0, next to arrows for the scan's zero direction
and the robot's front, so the mounting yaw can be checked by eye.

Camera video is taken from the ffmpeg_image_transport topics
(<camera>/image_raw/ffmpeg, H.264 or H.265 packets) and logged as an encoded
video stream, so nothing is decoded or re-encoded here. Cameras are found
while running, so they can start after the bridge.

The head camera's depth stream (<camera>/depth/image_raw, 16-bit, hardware-registered to
color) is logged alongside its color video and camera_info at the same entity, so the
viewer back-projects it into a colored 3D point cloud on its own - no point cloud topic
is subscribed to or parsed here.

The Logs tab is two side-by-side panels sharing the same ros_time timeline: ROS2
Log (/rosout, every node's log messages) and MCP Calls (tools/mcp_server's own
call_log.py audit trail, logs/mcp_calls.jsonl, tailed from disk - the MCP server
has no ROS dependency, so this is a file read, not a subscription). Each MCP
entry shows the call, the agent's stated reason, and the result/error together,
so "what was the agent doing, and what did the stack say back" reads next to
"what was ROS2 saying at that same moment" without digging through two tools.

Usage (bringup already running):
    python3 tools/rerun_bridge.py
    python3 tools/rerun_bridge.py --save run.rrd    # record to a file, no viewer
    python3 tools/rerun_bridge.py --connect rerun+http://laptop:9876/proxy
        # run on the robot, show in a viewer started elsewhere with `rerun`
