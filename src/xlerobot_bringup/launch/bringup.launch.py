"""Base bringup: robot_state_publisher + controller_manager + spawners.
No arms, no sensors yet, that's the phase 1 scope. Point bus1_port/bus2_port
at your udev symlinks, not the raw ttyACM device, those numbers swap on reboot.

use_sim:=true switches to the Isaac Sim twin's hardware interface instead
of the real bus (or sts_hardware_interface's mock mode), see docs/sim-twin.md.
bus1_port/bus2_port are ignored in that case. The Isaac Sim scene needs to
be playing (Play pressed in the GUI, or app_utils.play() in a script) for
its side of the ROS 2 bridge to actually publish/subscribe anything.

teleop:=true also brings up xlerobot_teleop's joystick/twist_mux/safety
supervisor stack (xlerobot_teleop/launch/teleop.launch.py). On by default,
since every real bringup needs the safety watchdog and a human-override
path; pass teleop:=false for a states-only/no-joystick bringup (e.g. CI,
or a headless box with no controller plugged in). The watchdog engages
e_stop until this bringup's own joint_state_broadcaster is actually
publishing, so there's no real ordering issue bringing both up together
this way, unlike running teleop.launch.py standalone before bringup is up.

record:=true records every topic to bags/<timestamp> (gitignored) for
offline debugging, camera video as H.264 packets only (raw and the other
image transports are left out, they are far too big and would make the
cameras encode them). foxglove:=true starts foxglove_bridge on the default
port 8765 for live inspection from Foxglove Studio. Both off by default.

cameras:=true starts the USB cameras from config/cameras.yaml, see
cameras.launch.py. Off by default, a camera that is not connected is skipped.

lidar:=true starts the LD19 (/dev/ldlidar), see lidar.launch.py. Off by default.
