"""Cameras, from config/cameras.yaml. Included by bringup.launch.py with cameras:=true, or run
standalone, optionally with config:=<other cameras.yaml> for a machine with different devices.

left/right (arm wrist cameras) are always plain USB webcams: one usb_cam node per camera whose
device exists, in the namespace cameras/<name>. image_transport's ffmpeg plugin encodes on
<name>/image_raw/ffmpeg while something subscribes to it.

head depends on the sensor:=usbcam|gemini arg (default gemini, matches xlerobot.urdf.xacro's own
default - see ADR-0003):
  - usbcam: same plain usb_cam node as left/right, from cameras.yaml's head entry.
  - gemini: the usb_cam entry for head is skipped entirely. Instead, the official
    orbbec_camera package's own gemini2.launch.py is included under an outer
    PushRosNamespace("cameras") with camera_name:="head" - gemini2.launch.py uses camera_name
    for both its own PushRosNamespace *and* literally as the composable node's name, and ROS 2
    node names can't contain "/" (confirmed by testing: passing camera_name:="cameras/head"
    directly throws "Couldn't parse remap rule" on the node's own __node:= argument) - two
    stacked namespace pushes (outer "cameras", inner "head" from the included file) gets the
    same cameras/head/... topic layout everything else uses, while keeping the node's own name
    a plain valid "head". Its color/image_raw and color/camera_info are remapped to
    cameras/head/image_raw and cameras/head/camera_info specifically, so existing flat-topic
    consumers (the MCP server's capture_image/remember_object, tools/rerun_bridge.py) keep
    working unchanged - depth/ir/point cloud are new capabilities nobody consumes yet, left at
    their native nested names (cameras/head/depth/image_raw etc.), clearer than remapping those
    too.

    The driver publishes its own calibrated extrinsic TF tree rooted at a link named
    "<camera_name>_link" - NOT a fixed "camera_link" (an earlier standalone test left
    camera_name at its own default, "camera", which happened to render as "camera_link" and
    looked like a hardcoded constant; it isn't - confirmed live once camera_name:="head" was
    actually passed here, which renames the whole tree to head_link -> head_depth_frame ->
    head_{color,ir}_frame -> head_{color,ir}_optical_frame, etc). xlerobot_description/urdf/
    sensors.xacro's gemini branch places a link named "head_link" at the physical mount
    point to match, so this tree attaches to the robot's own TF chain instead of floating
    disconnected from it. That tree is only actually published when
    enable_publish_extrinsic:=true is passed - the vendor launch file defaults it to false,
    in which case the node still advertises /tf and /tf_static but never sends anything on
    them (confirmed live: only robot_state_publisher's static transforms showed up without
    this).
