# Tools

Every script in `tools/`, grouped by what it's for. Each one also has its own usage in its
docstring (`--help` where it takes args) - this is the index, not a replacement for reading
the script itself.

## Setup

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `xlerobot_setup_usb_modules.py` | Pins `/dev/xle-bus1`/`xle-bus2` and camera/microphone device names via udev rules, matched by USB physical port and serial - run once per machine. See the main [README's bus layout section](../README.md#bus-layout). |

## Process management

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `kill_ros.py` | Finds and kills every process belonging to this project's ROS 2 stack, on whichever machine it's run on. `--yes` to skip the confirmation, `--dry-run` to just list. |
| `isaac_sim_sleep_guard.sh` | Masks systemd's sleep targets for the duration of an Isaac Sim session - suspending while the Isaac Sim process is up can hard-hang the machine, see the script's own header for why. `disable` before starting Isaac Sim, `enable` after. |

## Servo bus and calibration

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `calibrate_arm.py` | `status` reads positions/temperature/voltage for an arm or the head, read-only. `calibrate` runs lerobot's own procedure (middle pose, then a sweep) and writes the result in lerobot's calibration file format. Its `Bus` class (raw Feetech protocol 0 over serial) is also what several raw-protocol diagnostics below import directly. |
| `fake_sts_bus.py` | Fakes two Feetech servo buses on ptys, so `sts_hardware_interface` (the real driver) can run against them with no hardware attached - for mock-hardware bringup. Logs every torque/goal write with the resulting position. |
| `estop.py` | Emergency stop (and `--release`) across every bus at once, calling `sts_hardware_interface`'s per-bus `/emergency_stop_<component>` service on each. |
| `calibrate_wheel_odometry.py` | Drives a measured calibration motion (`straight-line` or `rotate-in-place`) and suggests the `wheel_radius`/`wheel_separation_multiplier` correction to apply by hand in `controllers.yaml`. See [ARCHITECTURE §6](../ARCHITECTURE.md#6-calibration). |

## Joint and controller diagnostics

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `single_joint_test.py` | Moves exactly one joint of a controller by a delta, holding every other joint of that controller at its current position. |
| `characterize_joint.py` | Sends one move at a known speed, logs `/joint_states` through it and a hold period after, and reports whether the joint is still converging (speed/timing problem) or settled at a persistent offset (steady-state/gravity/compliance problem). |
| `moveit_tracking_diag.py` | Plans a single-joint move through MoveIt (plan only), then sends that exact trajectory straight to the controller's `FollowJointTrajectory` action (bypassing `move_group`'s own executor) and logs desired/actual/error feedback at full rate. |
| `acc_test.py`, `matrix_test.py`, `repeat_test.py`, `speed600_test.py`, `stream_test.py`, `syncwrite_test.py` | Raw Feetech-protocol probes (bypass ROS entirely, via `calibrate_arm.py`'s `Bus` class) built to isolate why a streamed trajectory tracked a commanded position more slowly than a one-shot move to the same target. See [`SERVO_STREAMING_DIAGNOSTICS.md`](../tools/SERVO_STREAMING_DIAGNOSTICS.md) for what each one isolates and how to read the results. |

## MoveIt 2 and arm motion

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `moveit_smoke_test.py` | End-to-end MoveIt check against whatever's running (mock, the Isaac twin, or the real robot): plans and executes to the rest pose and a nearby pose, moves the gripper, checks IK against FK, and confirms an in-collision goal is refused. |
| `head_moveit_test.py` | Quick plan+execute check for the `head` MoveIt group. |
| `generate_moveit_collisions.py` | Generates the self-collision matrix (adjacent/default/always/never link pairs) the way the Setup Assistant does, without its GUI - queries `move_group`'s `/check_state_validity` over random poses. |
| `move_to_pose.py` | Plans and executes a Cartesian move of an arm's gripper to an `(x, y, z)` point (position-only IK), for targets that come from vision rather than a fixed joint configuration. |
| `goto_position.py`, `save_position.py`, `list_positions.py`, `playback_sequence.py` | Named-position workflow: save the current joint configuration of a MoveIt group under a name, list what's saved, move to one, or move through several in sequence. Shared storage in `position_store.py` (`src/xlerobot_bringup/config/saved_positions.yaml`, curated and tracked in git). |

## Navigation

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `nav_forward.py` | Sends Nav2 a goal a fixed distance straight ahead of the robot's current pose and watches it through, with a travel and timeout limit. |
| `goto_waypoint.py`, `save_waypoint.py`, `list_waypoints.py` | Named-waypoint workflow: save the robot's current AMCL-localized map pose under a name, list what's saved, or send Nav2 to one and watch it complete. Shared storage in `waypoint_store.py` (`src/xlerobot_bringup/config/saved_waypoints.yaml`). |
| `home_marker_calibrate.py`, `home_marker_localize.py`, `generate_home_marker.py`, `home_marker_common.py` | Tag-based AMCL cold-start seeding: print the generated ArUco marker and mount it somewhere fixed, run `home_marker_calibrate.py` once (well-localized) to save its map-frame pose, then `home_marker_localize.py` at every future cold start to publish `/initialpose` from wherever the robot can see the marker - no manual "2D Pose Estimate" needed. Reads the head camera's own live `camera_info` for its frame, so this works the same regardless of which `sensor:=` is in use. |

## Trajectory record and replay

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `record_trajectory.py` | Hand-guided (kinesthetic teaching) recording: cuts torque on the relevant bus(es), streams `/joint_states` while the arm is moved by hand, and saves the sampled trajectory on Ctrl-C. Supports single groups (`left_arm`, `right_arm`, `head`, a gripper) and the composite `both_arms` group for synchronized two-arm recordings. |
| `replay_trajectory.py` | Replays a recorded trajectory as `FollowJointTrajectory` goal(s) - one goal per controller, sent concurrently for a composite group like `both_arms` so multi-arm motions stay in sync. No collision checking; it's resending exactly what was recorded. |

## Camera and perception

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `capture_image.py` | Grabs a single frame from a camera's `image_raw` topic and saves it as a PNG under `captures/` (gitignored). |
| `calibrate_camera_charuco.py` | Live ChArUco calibration against a camera's real-time feed - move the board in front of the camera while it collects samples. Can watch a camera over the network from another machine, since it's just a ROS 2 subscription. |
| `calibrate_from_bag.py` | Same calibration math as above, but reading images from a recorded rosbag instead of a live feed, so the dataset is fixed once and the math can be iterated on without re-recording. |

## Spatial memory

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `spatial_memory_math.py` | Pure math (no ROS node needed) for turning a `(pixel, camera pose)` observation into a 3D point estimate - plane intersection for a single observation, triangulation for two or more from different viewpoints. Used by the MCP server's `remember_object`. |
| `spatial_memory_store.py` | Load/save for the agent's own remembered-object cache (`captures/spatial_memory.yaml`, gitignored - working memory, not curated config). |

## Visualization

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `rerun_bridge.py` | Streams the robot model, odometry, velocities, Nav2 goal/plan, lidar scan, the SLAM map, camera video and the head camera's depth (back-projected into a 3D point cloud on the viewer side) into [Rerun](https://rerun.io/) for timeline debugging - complements RViz/Foxglove rather than replacing them. Also has a Logs tab combining `/rosout` with the MCP server's own call log. |

## MCP server

`tools/mcp_server/` is its own thing - an MCP server exposing the robot to LLM agents (saved
positions/waypoints, spatial memory, camera capture with pose context, navigation and arm
motion tools). See [`tools/mcp_server/README.md`](../tools/mcp_server/README.md).
